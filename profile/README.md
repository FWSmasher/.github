# FWSmasher
A small, but dedicated team to finding exploits within many operation systems, mainly ChromeOS, but we are planning find more on more platforms. We are primarily targeting firmware and bootrom exploits (some of which we have found).  
All exploits in this organization is private, but will be public in 4+ months. There isn't much to say here, but if you are an fwsmasher member, please don't make any repos public.
